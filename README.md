# paylocity_deduction_confirmation_pull
Input sheet with Payroll Company ID, Payroll ID, and Deduction Amount, return a .csv of confirmed deduction amounts for a specific deduction code and check date. This is a way to confirm deductions that were requested, were taken accurately and successfully. IF there's a discrepancy, I use this tool to pull the true deduction amounts from paystubs.
